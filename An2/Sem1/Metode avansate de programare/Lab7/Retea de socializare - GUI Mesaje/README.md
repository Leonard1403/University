Project made in Java with graphical interface made in JavaFX.

Description:
The project has a graphical interface for sign-in. The client logs in with the data stored in the database. In case the client doesn't have an account, they can create a new one by clicking on the sign-in button. After clicking the button, the authentication data is entered, and then the client is saved in the database. Later on, the client can connect to the database.

The client has the possibility to search for a user in the application's user list, can delete a friendship, or accept a received friendship request. Behind each requirement explained in this paragraph, there is an observer that watches over all users connected to the platform, making a change in each window when something happens in one of the windows.
