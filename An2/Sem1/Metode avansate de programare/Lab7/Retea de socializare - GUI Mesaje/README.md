# Java Project with JavaFX UI

**Description**  
This project includes a graphical interface for signing in (authentication). The client logs in with data stored in a database. If the client does not have an account, they can create a new one by clicking the "sign-in" button, entering their data, and then saving the new client to the database. Later, the client can connect to the database.

## Features

- **User Search**: A client can look up other users in the applicationâ€™s user list.  
- **Friendship Management**: Clients can delete a friendship or accept a received friendship request.  
- **Real-Time Updates**: An observer monitors all users connected to the platform, so any change (in one window) is immediately reflected across all the other windows.  
- **Messaging**: Users can communicate with each other via a chatbox.

## Architecture

Below is the multi-layer (MVC) structure used in the project:

This design separates the logic into **Model**, **View**, and **Controller** layers, making the application modular and easier to maintain.
