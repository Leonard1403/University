# Tourism Agency
In this file, u can find a project for a Tourism Agency.

Description: At a lab i Had to do a project about a Tourism Agency that can do the following stuf:
1. It can Add an Offert for a Name, Destination, Type and a Price
2. It can modify those stuff 
3. It can made an wishlist with Offerts
4. It can export in a file
5. It can sort(i think the sorting is bubble sort or the naive sorting)

In the corner u can observe that there are some buttons.
Those buttons show u how many Offers u have from this type.
